# Project 1 - Exploratory Viz: A Look at Conjunto music styles

-------------
My exploratory project will directly relate to my work with a community-based nonprofit which aims to preserve and perpetuate traditional Conjunto music. This project will explore different music sub-styles under the Conjunto music genre. The central topic and focus of this project is to inform and illustrate some of the different musical styles that fall within the genre of Conjunto music, such as polkas, boleros, paso dobles, vals, etc. The intended primary audience is students from the organization with which I work, especially new/beginner students. The project aims to serve as a supplemental educational resource for the students as they learn about the various sub-styles within the genre. Although conjunto music is widely celebrated in South Texas and Northern Mexico, the music has recently gained popularity in other areas and continues to draw attention from music enthusiasts in other regions, so as a secondary audience, I hope to engage music professionals and scholars, like ethnomusicologists and folklorists who are interested in learning more about Conjunto music.

The main goal for design is to emulate the 31 buttons of a 3-row button accordion, the main instrument used in traditional Conjunto music. To best emulate the 31 buttons, I will explore 31 songs for each button, using circle shapes or points within a grid layout. I am still exploring ways in which I can best execute this design idea. If I am unable to identify a way to execute this design idea, I will opt for a design similar to the tile grid structure in the inspiration project I have outlined below.

The project will also encompass a preface section to provide basic information on the Conjunto genre and sub-styles explored. I envision this part of the project at the top/beginning of the visualization so as to serve as a clear preface to the main project. I am currently brainstorming graph/information design types to best visualize this part.

# Data
The data used will be derived from a larger, working dataset, gathered and organized by myself and the instructors at Conjunto Heritage Taller (https://conjuntoheritagetaller.com/). The data is mostly categorical and will focus mainly on the following variables:

    -Song Title

    -Primary Conjunto sub-style

        -any secondary sub-styles in the song
