        <h6> <i>"Conjunto — the traditional music of South Texas — dates back to the end of the 19th century. European settlers moved into the area with their button accordions and began ‘making music’ with the Mexican natives, who favored the bajo sexto (a lower sixth bass guitar traditionally used in Norteño music). The results were magical, and became the signature sound of South Texas — particularly San Antonio. The term "Conjunto", in this context, refers to a "collective" of musicians — the acordeonista and bajista — while the genre actually encompasses several musical styles. Let's explore a few Conjunto music styles."</i><p> <a href="https://conjuntoheritagetaller.com/" target="_blank"> -Conjunto Heritage Taller </a> </p></h6>
