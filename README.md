This repository contains files for my Exploratory & Narrative Visualization Projects for DATA 73200 (Interactive Data Visualization) 

As an arts admin based in San Antonio, Texas, my work focusses on methods of promoting and preserving regional arts & culture. This translates into my graduate research and projects, wherein I explore themes in regionally and culturally specific music forms that are deeply rooted in my community. My exploratory project surrounds styles of Conjunto music. The central focus of this project is to inform and illustrate some of the different musical styles that fall within the genre of Conjunto music, such as polkas, boleros, paso dobles, vals, etc. My narrative project aims to portray the story of San Antonioâ€™s Westside Sound with a focus on mapping places that contributed and/or continue to contribute to the music, such as venues, record labels, record shops, and more.
