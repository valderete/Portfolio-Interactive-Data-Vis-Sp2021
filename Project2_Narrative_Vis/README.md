# Project 2 - Exploratory Viz: 
# How San Antonio's 1960's Westside Sound Gave Life to Chicano Soul Music
    a look at the music through a data lens

-------------
My narrative project aims to portray the story of Chicano Soul music with a focus on the genre's roots in San Antonio, Texas, where the music was born. Considering my work surrounding Conjunto music (as explored in my exploratory project), I wanted my narrative project to remain within the realms of my interests and work with regional music and culture that is deeply rooted in my community. Derived from a mix of various musical styles, including some aspects of conjunto music, Chicano Soul was, and still remains, a prominant staple in San Anto history and culture. The intended primary audience is a broad mix of music enthusiasts, especially those interested in the styles that influenced and shaped Chicano Soul (i.e. R & B, rock n' roll, Motown), as well as San Antonio locals and historians. A long-term goal for this project is that this serves as an archival project as well, documenting, recounting, and preserving the history of the Westside Sound. 

The main narrative components of this project aim to communicate the following:

    1) What is "Westside Sound" and "Chicano Soul" - breif descriptions of the musical styles to be presented as text or network diagram.

    2) Mapping the "Westside Sound" - a map of prominant venues, studios, radio stations, festivals, retailers, etc. that were/are significant to the musical style.
        -Details about the areas in which prominant artists/groups were formed.

    3) Song/Artist analytics timeline - (in chronological order) muscic chart rankings, record sales, streaming stats
    
    4) Influence - an overview of similar artists as determined by Spotify's "related artists" to be visualized in a tree map or hierarchical diagram. A look at whether some artists' music has evolved in a similar trajectory to artists who pioneered the Westside Sound, chart type to be determined, but I am considering a series of bar graphs in a side-by-side layout for comparison.
    
    5) *contingent on time* Prominence today - a "fun fact" section to explore the presence of Chicano Soul today via a list of samples, features, new/re-releases, etc.

# Data
I will collect the data for this project, using mostly methods of manual collection, organizing, and research. The data will be mostly text and categorical with some quantitative/numeric values. Below are some variables I plan to use:

        -Artist Names
        -Song Title
        -Music chart rankings
        -Labels
        -Record sales
